1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
Server-side routing refers to the traditional network routing method used on
  the Web since the beginning. Basically a client sends a request to a server for a document, and the server then responds by sending the client that document. When the client clicking a link or submitting a form a new request is sent to the server, and it responds to that request. This involves a whole lot of page refreshes.
- Client-side routing means that the client is doing all of the real heavy        lifting, when changing views and moving data around goes. Interaction with the
  server is facilitated through AJAX calls that are used only when the application
  requires it.
